This project is a basic library management system written in C, created by me and Badreddine Younsi . It enables efficient management of books and clients, featuring functionalities to add, search, display, and delete records. Additionally, it includes a borrowing system that uses queues to track and manage book loans, ensuring books are marked as unavailable when borrowed and restored upon return. The project demonstrates core programming concepts like file handling, data structures, and queue implementation, with data persistence managed through text files (bib.txt and client.txt).
